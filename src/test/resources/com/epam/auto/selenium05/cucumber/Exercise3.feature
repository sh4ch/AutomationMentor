Feature: Testing VIP checkbox functionality on the User Table Page

  As a user, I want to check and verify the 'vip' checkbox functionality and logs.

  Scenario: Select 'vip' checkbox for a user and verify log entry
    Given I open JDI GitHub site
    And I login as user "Roman Iovlev"
    And I click on "Service" button in Header
    And I click on "User Table" button in Service dropdown

    When I select 'vip' checkbox for "Sergey Ivan"
    Then 1 log row has "Vip: condition changed to true" text in log section
