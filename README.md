# AutomationMentor

On my project there are two Automation Engineers.
We work according to Scrum, developing new features for the People Managing application.
Each sprint is two weeks
Automation is applied for:
* new features we implement (creating new Tests),
* run regression for the App's area that was affected by the new feature,
* support Jenkins jobs for Development/Testing Environment.

Tech stack: Java, TestNG, Jenkins, ALM
